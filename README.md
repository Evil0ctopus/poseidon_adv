## Safety / Authorized Use

**POSEIDON is an educational wireless auditing lab for security research on hardware and networks you own or have explicit permission to test.**

- Use only on **your own equipment** or systems where you have **written authorization**.
- Do **not** use this firmware for unauthorized access, interference, jamming, or disruption of third-party networks or devices.
- You are responsible for complying with local radio and computer-misuse laws (e.g. FCC / Ofcom / ETSI and equivalents).
- Captured data (handshakes, probes, logs) may include personal information — handle it lawfully.

If you are unsure whether a use is allowed, treat it as **not allowed**. See the upstream [Legal & Responsible Use](https://generaldussduss.github.io/poseidon/legal.html) page for fuller guidance.

## About POSEIDON (Community Edition)

**POSEIDON** is a pocket-sized, keyboard-first **wireless auditing and security-research lab** built for the **M5Stack Cardputer-Advance** (ESP32-S3, QWERTY keyboard, 240×135 color display). Research modules cover Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Sub-GHz, 2.4 GHz, LoRa, Infrared, and LAN — intended for learning RF/embedded security concepts and testing **owned** gear.

This fork (`poseidon_adv`) builds on the GeneralDussDuss release with stability work, performance tweaks, and features aimed at lab / field evaluation on authorized hardware.

* **170+ research modules:** Broad coverage across Wi-Fi, BLE, Sub-GHz, 2.4 GHz, LoRa, Infrared, and LAN for recon and defensive assessment in authorized environments.
* **QWERTY-driven interface:** Letter-mnemonic menus and direct parameter typing (no thumb-stick scrolling).
* **Argus autonomous Gotchi:** A reactive 96×96 mood sprite that can hunt handshakes on owned networks using an SD-persisted reinforcement-learning brain.
* **Deepwater interface:** Eleven themes, crisp domain icons, compact list/card layouts, optional ambient decoration and reduced motion.

## What's New & Custom Changes in `poseidon_adv`

* **Deepwater redesign:** Shared bounded text/chrome, a short skippable boot reveal, scrollable help, paged shortcuts and display accessibility settings.
* **Real-time sensor awareness:** Dedicated monitoring helpers for Flock ALPR and ShotSpotter Raven fingerprints (lab / awareness tooling — not for unauthorized targeting).
* **Triton RPG Gotchi leveling:** Persistent XP tracking and interactive leveling tied to Argus.
* **Expanded UI palettes & screensavers:** Eleven themes and thirteen ambient screensavers; animation is optional.
* **On-device data management:** Integrated hex and log viewers on the display.
* **Advanced connectivity:** GATT notification streaming, richer device/OS fingerprinting, and expanded support for hardware hat expansion modules.

## Deepwater interface

- **Boot:** a pixel-aligned trident reveal automatically opens the menu after about 900 ms. Any key skips; security-key boot mode still bypasses the splash.
- **Navigation:** Terminal shows six rows (four with large text) and the selected item's description. Carousel shows one domain card with consistent icons. Letter shortcuts, `;`/`.` navigation, ENTER, Back and `=`/`?` help remain available. Changing layouts returns immediately to the root.
- **Text:** names fit columns with visible `...` overflow. Help scrolls with `;`/`.`; ENTER or Back closes it.
- **Shortcut hints:** `Ctrl+/` advances long footers (`^/ more`). TAB remains available to features that use it.
- **Display settings:** `System → Display` controls motion (`M`), large text (`B`) and ambient decoration (`A`). Large text enlarges menu labels, WiFi/BLE results, help and notices; status and secondary metadata stay compact.
- **Feedback:** notices wrap and can be dismissed early. Destructive device settings and file deletion require confirmation; Back cancels.
- **SaltyJack:** theme-aware 16px icons, a paged grid with every tool reachable, shared footer paging and scrollable help. No second entry splash.
- **Memory:** no full-screen animation buffers for menu transitions or event panels. No PSRAM requirement. Heap diagnostics remain in `System → Heap`.

The default POSEIDON theme now uses navy, ice-white and cyan with restrained lavender. Existing saved theme IDs and explicit ambient preferences are preserved. New ambient preferences default off; reduced motion pauses decoration and automatic animated screensavers, not live measurements.

| Theme | Aesthetic |
|---|---|
| POSEIDON | Deepwater navy / ice-white / cyan — default |
| MATRIX | Phosphor green |
| E-INK | Paper white and dark text |
| SYNTHWAVE | Magenta and cyan on midnight grape |
| PHANTOM | Violet and lavender |
| BLOOD | Red on black |
| AMBER CRT | Warm amber terminal |
| NIGHT CITY | Electric yellow and cyan |
| SOLARIS | Solar gold on charcoal |
| NORDIC FROST | Glacial cyan and silver |
| GHOST PURPLE | Electric violet on obsidian |

## Quick Start & Installation

Use the **Deepwater binaries from this fork**, not upstream's older release.
The [release downloads](https://github.com/Evil0ctopus/poseidon_adv/releases/latest)
and [tracked binaries](release_binaries/) contain the same design:

| Installation | Binary | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Standalone / M5Burner | `poseidon-factory.bin` | Full factory image at `0x0`; replaces the flash layout |
| M5Stack Launcher | `poseidon-launcher.bin` | App-only image; install through Launcher's SD/WebUI flow |
| Existing custom dual-app unit | `poseidon-launcher-dual.bin` | App-only image for the verified layout below; never a factory flash |

**Do not flash the factory image over Launcher or another multi-app installation.**
Back up your device and verify its partition table before a manual update.

### Web Flasher

Open [this fork's installer](https://evil0ctopus.github.io/poseidon_adv/install.html)
in Chrome or Edge, connect a Cardputer-Advance and install the standalone image.
The [manifest](docs/manifest.json) points to this fork's tracked Deepwater factory binary.
Website availability depends on this repository's GitHub Pages deployment.

### M5Burner

Use [M5Stack WebBurner](https://burner.m5stack.com/) with the Deepwater factory image for a
standalone installation. The versioned [catalog metadata](docs/m5burner.json)
describes this fork's release. An upstream POSEIDON listing is maintained
separately: changing this repository does not automatically update an
M5Burner account's public catalog entry.
Launcher catalog availability is separate too; the app-only GitHub download
can be installed directly through Launcher without waiting for a catalog update.

### Launcher and custom layouts

Install `poseidon-launcher.bin` through M5Stack Launcher's application installer.
For raw flashing, determine the destination slot from the actual partition
table; do not assume the standard profile's `0x170000` offset.

The connected development unit uses [launcher_dual_app_8Mb.csv](support_files/launcher_dual_app_8Mb.csv):
POSEIDON at `0x1E0000`, capacity `0x2D0000`; Meshtastic at `0x4B0000`.
`cardputer-launcher-dual` describes that existing layout. Update only its
POSEIDON application slot. Do not flash its table, a factory image, or use
PlatformIO's full upload target over that installation.

## Building and validation

```text
pio run -e cardputer -e cardputer-launcher -e cardputer-launcher-dual
pio test -e native-test -f test_ui_layout -f test_wifi_logic -f test_ble_db -f test_heap_budget
```

On Windows, with development firmware running on a connected Cardputer:

```powershell
.\scripts\test_deepwater_ui.ps1 -Port COM5
```

For release packaging after building all three profiles:

```powershell
.\scripts\prepare_deepwater_release.ps1 -Version 0.8.0
```

This refreshes the [distribution binaries](release_binaries/README.md), legacy
aliases, browser image and SHA256 sums together.

The smoke script exercises UI navigation, all eleven theme previews, display
settings and **cancel-only** confirmation dialogs, including SaltyJack's list,
paged grid, card and help views without running its tools. It restores the
starting theme/layout/display preferences, checks paint timing against 100 ms
and checks retained heap. Artifacts go under `.pio\ui-smoke`.

Serial `D` reads back the LCD in one-row chunks with a checksum. Unsupported
readback is reported, not counted as successful screenshots. `-SkipCapture`
runs navigation checks alone. Readback pauses input while streaming; use it on
idle menus, not time-critical operations. Paint timing is not end-to-end
keyboard latency or a guarantee for every feature.

Verified on the Cardputer-Adv during the redesign: **33/33 native tests**,
all three firmware profiles and the final hardware sweep passed. Menu paint
maximum was **41 ms**, boot reveal **925 ms**, and the final warmed sweep
retained no additional heap. Application-only flashing passed hash verification;
partition-table readback matched the backup byte-for-byte. This was shared UI
and safe navigation validation, not a transmit/destructive-operation audit.
